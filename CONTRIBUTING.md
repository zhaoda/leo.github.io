# Hey you!

Thank you for wanting to contribute to my site. Here are some things you should consider before commiting a bug-fix or maybe even a new feature:

## Editing posts

- Every time you make changes to a file within the `_posts` directory (fixing a grammar-error for example), please make sure adjust the value of the `updated` meta-property to the current one.
- When adding completely new text-paragraphs to an article, add the word "EDIT" written in bold text to the beginning of the same. Also add a `---` seperator before and after the new text. Here's [an example][1].
